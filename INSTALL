INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1) Make sure you have gnustep installed.
   
2) Make sure your java environment is well configured.  
   At least one of the following should be true: 
  
  * typing 'javac' at the shell prompt should run the java compiler
  (ie, you have set up your PATH environment variable);

  * $JAVA_HOME is set to the base of your java development
  environment distribution (so that for example javac would be located in
  $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac).

  * Make certain that the $JAVA_OS variable is also set.  If this or the
  JAVA_HOME variable are not set properly, lib-jigs will not build properly.

[Please note that you may switch at any time to a different Java environment
simply by resetting the old shell variables to new values appropriate for
the new environment.  You do not need to recompile or reinstall JIGS nor any
GNUstep based java packages or apps.]

3) Compile JIGS: 

    make 

4) Install JIGS: Become root, then type:

    make install

5) Create and Compile the base library wrapper: Go into Wrappers/base
   (or into Wrapper/libFoundation if you are using libFoundation), and
   type:

   make

[Warning: you need to have installed JIGS (step 4) before you can
compile any wrapper]

6) Install the base library wrapper:  Become root, then type: 

   make install

7) Play with JIGS.  The best place to start is the Testing/Java
    directory.  See the README there for more info.
